A webApp aimed for fitness.<br><br>It has got lot of features which is available in all fitness apps nowadays,however the x-factor of this app is the usage of AI for monitoring the excercises using camera.<br> It counts each set only if the excercise is done properly.<br>Since its a prototype the aesthetics wont be much pleasing.<br>Thank you for using the app.
